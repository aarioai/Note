# HVS (Human Visual System)

Your cornea and lens provide the focus, while the iris adjusts to let the optimal amount of light reach your retina. **The retina converts the image formed by the light rays into nerve impulses.** The optic nerve, composed of the axons of the retina's ganglion cells, then transmits these impulses from the eye to the first visual relay in the brain.

The cornea does not have any blood vessels, so it takes its nutrients from the aqueous humor behind it. The cornea is continuous with the **sclera**. Three pairs of musclues are inserted into the sclera. It is there ocular muscles that enable the eyeball to move in its socket in the skull.

The **choriod**, a richly vascularized layer that delivers nutrients to the iris and the retina, contains many dark pigments that make the inside of the eye, as seen through the pupil, appear black.

The aqueous humor and the vitreous humor play an essential role in focusing the image on the retina.

**Pupil** lets light reach the retina. The diameter of the pupil is controlled by the **iris**, a circular muscle.

**Pupillary reflex**: on a dark night, your pupils are big and black, because your irises open wide.

The **lens** is attached via the suspensory ligaments to the ciliary muscles, which in turn are attached to the sclera.

The blood vessels enter the eye through a colorless region of the retina, known as the **optic disc**. The optic disc is also the head of the optic nerve; it is here that the axons of the retina's ganglion cells converge and exit the eye.

![optic disc](https://github.com/AarioAi/share/blob/master/_asset/2-optic-disc.jpg?raw=true)

Because there are no photoreceptors in the optic disc, this part of retina is insensitive to light, just as it is at the location where the largest blood vessels pass. For this reason, the optic disc is also known as **blind spot**.

> You do not experience any interruption in your field of vision at your eye's blind spots, because the brain has a way of "filling in" your visual perceptions at theses locations.

At the center of each retina there's also a darker area called **macula** that is practically devoid of blood vessels, in order to optimise center vision. **Fovea**, a black spot about 2mm in diameter, is composed exclusively of cones and where visual acuity is greatest.

## Optic Nerve

The axons of the retina's ganglion cells collect in a bundle at the optic disc, emerge from the back of the eye to form the **optic nerve** and pass through the optic nerve, the optic chiasm, and the optic tractus. They wrap around the midbrain and cross the medial surface of the temporal lobe, and 80% of them then terminate in LGN(Lateral Geniculate Nucleus).

![optic nerve](https://github.com/AarioAi/share/blob/master/_asset/2-optic-nerve.jpg?raw=true)

The optic nerves of the two eyes emerge from their optics discs and intersect at the **optic chiasm** just in front of the **pituitary gland**.

![visual field](https://github.com/AarioAi/share/blob/master/_asset/2-visual-field.jpg?raw=true)

The axons from the nasal side of each retina cross sides in the optic chiasm so that the left halt of the field of vision is perceived by the right cerebral hemisphere, and vice versa. The axons from the temporal(non-nasal) side proceed straight ahead through the **optic tract**.

The vast majority of the nerve fibres in the optic tract project to the LGN(lateral geniculate nucleus) in the dorsal part of the thalamus. The LGN is the first and the main relay in the pathway to the primary visual cortext. The projection from the LGN to the visual cortext is called the **optic radiation**. Because damage at any point along the pathway from the retina to the cortex results in some degree of blindness.

The SCN(suprachiasmatic nucleus) is considered the primary site of the boy's internal biological clock.

Axons from some other retinal ganglion cells project to the **pretectum** that controls the opening of the pupil and certain eye movements.

![Lateral Geniculate Nucleus](https://github.com/AarioAi/share/blob/master/_asset/2-LGN.jpg?raw=true)

In cross-section, the left and right LGNs are seen to be organized into 6 dinstinc cell layers.

Because the right LGN processes all of the visual signals from the left visual field, it receives axons from the left nasal retina and the right temporal retina. The axons from the ipsilateral eye synapse on cell layers 2, 3 and 5 in the LGN, whereas those from controlateral eye project to layers 1, 4 and 6.

The LGN's ventral layers (1 and 2, Magnocellular layers) contains larger neurons than its more dorsal layers (3, 4, 5, and 6, Parvocellular layers). These type M ganglion cellsthat project to its magnocellular layers of the LGN, and the type P ganglion cells that project to its parvocellular layers.

Despite the great influence that innervation from the retina has on the structure of the LGN, about 80% of the excitatory inputs to the LGN come not from the retina but from the V1(primary visual cortext) and lower centers in the brains.

## Visual Cortex

It is in the **primary visual cortex** (striate cortext or V1) that the brain begins to reconstitute the image from the **receptive fields** of the cells of teh retina. The V1 cortex is located in the most posterior portion of the brain's occipital lobe.

Hierarchical relationships between a V1 cortex and V2 cortexes are found in several parts of the brain, including the sensory, motor, and auditory cortexes.

![Visual Cortexes](https://github.com/AarioAi/share/blob/master/_asset/2-visual-cortexes.jpg?raw=true)

There appear to be two major cortical systems for processing visual information: a **ventral visual pathway** that expends to the temporal lobe, and a **dorsal visual pathway** that projects to the parietal lobe.

The basic function of the ventral visual pathway seems to be to let us consiously perceive, recognize, and identify objects by processing their "intrinsic" visual properties, such as shape and color. The basic function of the dorsal visual pathway seems to be to let us exercise visual-motor control over objects by processing their "extinsic" properties, such as their size, position and orientation in space.
